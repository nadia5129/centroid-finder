    /**
     * Returns the euclidean color distance between two hex RGB colors.
     * 
     * Each color is represented as a 24-bit integer in the form 0xRRGGBB, where
     * RR is the red component, GG is the green component, and BB is the blue component,
     * each ranging from 0 to 255.
     * 
     * The Euclidean color distance is calculated by treating each color as a point
     * in 3D space (red, green, blue) and applying the Euclidean distance formula:
     * 
     * sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2)
     * 
     * This gives a measure of how visually different the two colors are.

        extract red:

        int redB = (colorB >> 16) & 0xFF;

        extract green: 
        int greenA = (colorA >> 8) & 0xFF;
        int greenB = (colorB >> 8) & 0xFF;

        extract blue: 
        int blueA = colorA & 0xFF;
        int blueB = colorB & 0xFF;

        int redDiff = redA - redB;
        int greenDiff = greenA - greenB;

        find square by multiplying by itself
